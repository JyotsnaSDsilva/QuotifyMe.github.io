     <h3> Love Quotes</h3>
	 
	 
<p>"When you say that you love me I walk above the clouds." ~BTS(Bangtan Sonyeondan), Best of Me 
	 <br><br>
"To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance." ~Oscar Wilde
<br><br>
"The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity and an understanding of life that fills them with compassions, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen." ~Elizabeth Kubler-Ross

<br><br>
"You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection." ~Buddha
<br><br>
"If you aren’t good at loving yourself, you will have a difficult time loving anyone, since you’ll resent the time and energy you give another person that you aren’t even giving to yourself." ~Barbara De Angelis
<br><br>
"The opposite of love is not hate; it's indifference." ~Elie Wiesel
<br><br>
"Love can change a person the way a parent can change a baby: awkwardly, and often with a great deal of mess." ~Lemony Snicket
<br><br>
"Do you know how you tell real love? It's when someone else's interest trumps your own. I like to put it that way: trumps your own. Love of somebody else — of family, of your kids — becomes the most important, most worthwhile thing in your life. It's what you foster and protect."  ~Brad Pitt
<br><br>
"We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone." ~Orson Wells
<br><br>
"Love involves a peculiar unfathomable combination of understanding and misunderstanding." ~Diane Arbus	 </p>
